- 👋 Hi, I’m @sheypatterson01
-         I tend to go by Bug or Cue for fun but Shey is just as good!
- 👀 I’m interested in data analytics and cyber security
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analytics in a bootcamp with UT
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing currently since I'm doing the school thing, but after that I look forward to many projects!
- 📫 How to reach me, shoot me an email at shey.patterson01@gmail.com
